In Babylonia, this region of the zodiac was known as the Sea.To the Greeks, Aquarius was associated with Ganymede, the son of Tros, king of Phrygia. The god Zeus, so admired the boy's beauty that, disguised as an eagle, he abducted him to serve as cup bearer on mount Olympus.

They have an interesting side to their nature that allows them to see a valid argument even when they disagree with it. They are quite objective folk and never get waylaid by being too close to an issue or person. \n\nAquarius is truly a humane, human being. Known, to be frank, and outspoken, Aquarius makes for a serious and genial companion. Refined and idealistic, romantic but practical, they are personable and likable people.\n\nQuick in mind and quick to respond, Aquarians love activity and are quite reasonable, though difficult to get close to.
